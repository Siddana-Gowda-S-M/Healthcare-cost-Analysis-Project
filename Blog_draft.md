# Predicting Healthcare Costs: Insights from Patient Data  

## Introduction  

Healthcare costs continue to rise globally, placing a significant burden on insurers, providers, and patients alike. Consequently, considerable research is devoted to controlling healthcare costs. Many efforts are underway to improve medical price transparency.Predictive modeling offers a powerful tool to anticipate these costs, enabling insurers to allocate resources more efficiently and design targeted interventions. Price transparency will help patients become better informed, allowing them to shop for care they can afford, eventually leading to efficiency in healthcare markets. This first requires medical pricing data to be made available publicly.
By analyzing patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and medical history, we can uncover patterns that drive expenses and develop strategies to mitigate them.Healthcare expenditure, a considerable proportion of national budgets, has risen rapidly. Since the raw pricing data can be large and cover multiple conditions, it is necessary to provide an engine to process the data to facilitate its usage and understanding. 

## Approach  

### Dataset Overview  
The dataset includes records for 50 patients, with the following features:  
- **Age**: Ranging from 21 to 79 years.  
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, from 18.8 (underweight) to 39.3 (obese).  
- **SmokingStatus**: Smoker or Non-Smoker.  
- **ChronicCondition**: Presence of a chronic condition (Yes/No).  
- **AnnualCost**: Healthcare costs ranging from \$5,150 to \$17,359.  

### Methods Used  
We employed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and trained a regression model to predict annual costs based on patient attributes. Key steps included:  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values.  
2. **Feature Analysis**: Examining correlations (e.g., smoking and chronic conditions with higher costs).  
3. **Modeling**: Using linear regression and random forest to predict costs.  

## Key Findings  

### Most Important Factors  
1. **Chronic Conditions**: Patients with chronic conditions incurred 20-30% higher costs on average.  
2. **Smoking**: Smokers had 15% higher costs than non-smokers, even after controlling for other factors.  
3. **BMI and Age**: Higher BMI and older age were associated with increased costs, though the relationship was nonlinear.  

### Model Performance  
- The random forest model achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.72**, indicating strong predictive power.  
- Top features: ChronicCondition, Age, and SmokingStatus.  

### Surprising Insights  
- Some younger smokers without chronic conditions had lower costs than expected, suggesting other mitigating factors (e.g., fewer hospital visits).  
- Patients with low BMI (<20) showed higher variability in costs, possibly due to undiagnosed conditions.  

## Real-World Impact  

### Applications for Insurers  
1. **Risk Stratification**: Identify high-cost patients early for preventive care.  
2. **Premium Pricing**: Adjust premiums based on predictive risk scores.  
3. **Targeted Interventions**: Offer smoking cessation programs or chronic disease management to high-risk groups.  

### Potential Cost Savings  
By targeting the top 10% of high-cost patients, insurers could reduce annual expenses by up to **12%** through early interventions.  

## Limitations and Next Steps  
- **Data Scope**: Larger datasets with more features e.g., genetics, detailed medical history could improve accuracy.  
- **Causality**: The model identifies correlations but not causation.  
- **Next Steps**: Test the model on broader populations and integrate real-time data for dynamic predictions.
